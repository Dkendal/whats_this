So I downloaded the javascript and css files as described
[here](https://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/download/index.html)
and also, for good measure, added the script line (from that page) to the
=layouts/partials/head.html= file of the theme.  Then copied the following 
snippet from the JSXGraph site:

#+begin_src html
<div id="box" class="jxgbox" style="width:500px; height:500px;"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
 var board = JXG.JSXGraph.initBoard('box', {boundingbox: [-10, 10, 10, -10], axis:true});
</script>
#+end_src

However, to make this work the entire script needs to be inside a =<div>=,
=</div>= pair, like this:

#+begin_src html
<div id="box" class="jxgbox" style="width:500px; height:500px;">
<script type="text/javascript">
 var board = JXG.JSXGraph.initBoard('box', {boundingbox: [-10, 10, 10, -10], axis:true});
</script>
</div>
#+end_src

Just to see how well this works, here's Archimedes' /neusis/ construction of an
angle trisection: given an angle $\theta$ in a unit semicircle, its trisection is
obtained by laying against the circle a straight line with points spaced 1
apart (drag point A about the circle to see this in action):
#+begin_export html 
<div id="box" class="jxgbox" style="width:750px; height:500px;">
<script type="text/javascript">
 JXG.Options.axis.ticks.insertTicks = false;
 JXG.Options.axis.ticks.drawLabels = false;
 var board = JXG.JSXGraph.initBoard('box', {boundingbox: [-1.5, 1.5, 3, -1.5],axis:true,keepAspectRatio:true});
 var p = board.create('point',[0,0],{visible:false,fixed:true});
 var neg = board.create('point',[-0.67,0],{visible:false,fixed:true});
 var c = board.create('circle',[[0,0],1.0]);
 var a = board.create('glider',[-Math.sqrt(0.5),Math.sqrt(0.5),c],{name:'A'});
 var l1 = board.create('segment',[a,p]);
 var ang = board.create('angle',[a,p,neg],{radius:0.67,name:'θ',type:'sector'});
 var theta = JXG.Math.Geometry.rad(a,p,neg);
 var bb = board.create('point',[
          () => Math.cos(Math.atan2(a.Y(),-a.X())/3),
          () => Math.sin(Math.atan2(a.Y(),-a.X())/3)
          ],{name:'B'});
 var w = board.create('point',[() =>  2*Math.cos(Math.atan2(a.Y(),-a.X())/3),0]);
 var l2 = board.create('line',[a,w]);
 var l3 = board.create('segment',[p,bb]);
 var l4 = board.create('segment',[bb,w],{strokeWidth:6,strokeColor:'#FF0000'});
 var ang2 = board.create('angle',[bb,w,neg],{radius:0.67,name:'θ/3'});
</script> 
</div>
#+end_export

For what it's worth, here is the splendid javascript code to produce the above
figure:

#+begin_src html
<div id="box" class="jxgbox" style="width:500px; height:333.33px;">
<script type="text/javascript">
 JXG.Options.axis.ticks.insertTicks = false;
 JXG.Options.axis.ticks.drawLabels = false;
 var board = JXG.JSXGraph.initBoard('box', {boundingbox: [-1.5, 1.5, 3, -1.5],axis:true});
 var p = board.create('point',[0,0],{visible:false,fixed:true});
 var neg = board.create('point',[-0.67,0],{visible:false,fixed:true});
 var c = board.create('circle',[[0,0],1.0]);
 var a = board.create('glider',[-Math.sqrt(0.5),Math.sqrt(0.5),c],{name:'A'});
 var l1 = board.create('segment',[a,p]);
 var ang = board.create('angle',[a,p,neg],{radius:0.67,name:'θ'});
 var theta = JXG.Math.Geometry.rad(a,p,neg);
 var bb = board.create('point',[function(){return Math.cos(Math.atan2(a.Y(),-a.X())/3);},function(){return Math.sin(Math.atan2(a.Y(),-a.X())/3);}],{name:'B'});
 var w = board.create('point',[function(){return Math.cos(Math.atan2(a.Y(),-a.X())/3)/0.5;},0]);
 var l2 = board.create('line',[a,w]);
 var l3 = board.create('segment',[p,bb]);
 var l4 = board.create('segment',[bb,w],{strokeWidth:6,strokeColor:'#FF0000'});
 var ang2 = board.create('angle',[bb,w,neg],{radius:0.67,name:'θ/3'});

Quite wonderful, it is.


** The trinomial theorem                      :mathematics:algebra:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: trinomial_theorem
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :mathjax true
:EXPORT_DATE: 2018-04-05
:END:
When I was teaching the binomial theorem (or, to be more accurate, the binomial
/expansion/) to my long-suffering students, one of them asked me if there was a
/trinomial/ theorem.  Well, of course there is, although in fact expanding sums
of greater than two terms is generally not classed as a theorem described by the
number of terms. The general result is

\[
(x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_k)^n=\sum_{a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_k=n}
{n\choose a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k}x_1^{a_1}x_2^{a_2}\cdots x_k^{a_k}
\]

so in particular a "trinomial theorem" would be

\[
(x+y+z)^n=\sum_{a+b+c=n}{n\choose a,b,c}x^ay^bz^c.
\]

Here we define

\[
{n\choose a,b,c}=\frac{n!}{a!b!c!}
\]

and this is known as a /trinomial coefficient/; more generally, for an arbitrary
number of variables, it is a /multinomial coefficient/.  It is guaranteed to be
an integer if the lower values sum to the upper value.

So to compute $(x+y+z)^5$ we could list all integers $a,b,c$ with $0\le a,b,c\le 5$
for which $a+b+c=5$, and put them all into the above sum.  

But of course there's a better way, and it comes from expanding $(x+y+z)^5$ as a
binomial $(x+(y+z))^5$ so that

\begin{array}{rcl}
(x+(y+x))^5&=&x^5\\
&&+5x^4(y+z)\\
&&+10x^3(y+z)^2\\
&&+10x^2(y+z)^3\\
&&+5x(y+z)^4\\
&&+(y+z)^5
\end{array}

Now we can expand each of those binomial powers:

\begin{array}{rcl}
(x+(y+x))^5&=&x^5\\
&&+5x^4(y+z)\\
&&+10x^3(y^2+2yz+z^2)\\
&&+10x^2(y^3+3y^2z+3yz^2+z^3)\\
&&+5x(y^4+4y^3z+6y^2z^2+4yz^3+z^4)\\
&&+(y^5+5y^4z+10y^3z^2+10y^2z^3+5yz^4+z^5)
\end{array}

Expanding this produces

\begin{split}
x^5&+5x^4y+5x^4z+10x^3y^2+20x^3yz+10x^3z^2+10x^2y^3+30x^2y^2z+30x^2yz^3\\
&+10x^2z^3+5zy^4+20xy^3z+30xy^2z^2+20xyz^3+5xz^4+y^5+5y^4z+10y^3z^2\\
&+10y^2z^3+5yz^4+z^5
\end{split}

which is an equation of rare beauty.

But there's a nice way of setting this up, which involves writing down Pascal's
triangle to the fifth row, and putting a fifth row, as a column, on the side.
Then multiply across:

\begin{array}{lcccccccccc}
1&&&&&&1&&&&&\\
5&&&&&1&&1&&&&\\
10\quad\times&&&&1&&2&&1&&&\\
10&&&1&&3&&3&&1&&\\
5&&1&&4&&6&&4&&1&\\
1&1&&5&&10&&10&&5&&1
\end{array}

to produce the final array of coefficients (with index numbers at the left):

\begin{array}{l*{10}{c}}
0\qquad{}&&&&&&1&&&&&\\
1&&&&&5&&5&&&&\\
2&&&&10&&20&&10&&&\\
3&&&10&&30&&30&&10&&\\
4&&5&&20&&30&&20&&5&\\
5&1&&5&&10&&10&&5&&1
\end{array}

Row $i$ of this array corresponds to $x^{5-i}$ and all combinations of powers
$y^bz^c$ for $0\le b,c\le i$.  Thus for example the fourth row down,
corresponding to \( i=3 \), may be considered as the coefficients of the terms

\[
x^2y^3,\quad x^2y^2z,\quad x^2yz^2,\quad xz^3.
\]

Note that the triangle of coefficients is symmetrical along all three centre
lines, as well as rotationally symmetric by 120°.

I've been using wordpress as my blogging platform since I first started, about
10 years ago.  (In fact the first post I can find is dated March 30, 2008.)  I
chose [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com) back then because it was (a) free,
and (b) supported mathematics through a version (or subset) of
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org).  As I have used LaTeX extensively for
all my writing since the early 1990's, it's a standard requirement for me.

Some time later I decided to start hosting my own server (well, a VPS), on which
I could use [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org), which is the self-hosted
version of wordpress.  The advantages of a self hosted blog are many, but I
particularly like the greater freedom, the ability to include a far greater
variety of plugins, and the larger choice of themes.  And one of the plugins I
liked particularly was [WP
QuickLaTeX](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-quicklatex/) which provided a LaTeX
engine far superior to the in-built one of wordpress.com.  Math bloggin heaven!

However, hosting my own wordpress site was not without difficulty.  First I had
to install it and get it up and running (even this was non-trivial), and then I
had to manage all the users and passwords: myself as a standard user, wp-admin
for accessing the Wordpress site itself, a few others.  I have quite a long list
containing all the commands I used, and all the users and passwords I created.

This served me well, but it was also slow to use.  My VPS is perfectly
satisfactory, but it is not fast (I'm too cheap to pay for much more than a
low-powered one), and the edit-save-preview cycle of online blogging with my
wordpress installation was getting tiresome.  

Plus the issue of security.  I've been hacked once, and I've since managed to
secure my site with a free certificate from [Let's
Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).  In fact, in many ways Let's Encrypt is one
of the best things to have happened for security.  An open Certificate Authority
is manna from heaven, as far as I'm concerned.

Wordpress is of course more than just blogging software.  It now grandly styles
itself as Site Building software and Content Management System, and the site
claims that "30% of the web uses Wordpress".  It is in fact hugely powerful and
deservedly popular, and can be used for pretty much whatever sort of site you
want to build.   Add to that a seemingly infinite set of plugins, and you have
an entire ecosystem of web-building.

However, all of that popularity and power comes at a cost: it is big, confusing,
takes work to maintain, keep secure, and keep up-to-date, and is a target for
hackers.  Also for me, it has become colossal overkill.  I don't need all those
bells and whistles; all I want to do is host my blog and share my posts with the
world (the $1.5\times 10^{-7}\%$ of the world who reads it).

The kicker for me was checking out a [mathematics education
blog](http://rtalbert.org) by an author I admire greatly, to discover it was
built with the static blog engine [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).  So being the
inventive bloke I am, I thought I'd do the same.

But a bit of hunting led me to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), which apparently is
very similar to jekyll, but much faster, and written in [Go](https://golang.org)
instead of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).  Since I know nothing about
either Go or Ruby I don't know if it's the language which makes the difference,
or something else.  But it sure looks nice, and supports
[mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org) for LaTeX.

So my current plan is to migrate from wordpress to Hugo, and see how it goes!

*** Election mapping

A few weeks ago there was a by-election in my local electorate (known as an
electoral /division/) of Batman here in Australia.  I was interested in
comparing the results of this election with the previous election two years ago.
In this division it's become a two-horse race: the Greens against the Australian
Labor Party.  Although Batman had been a solid Labor seat for almost its entire
existence - it used to be considered one of the safest Labor seats in the
country - over the past decade or so the Greens have been making inroads into
this Labor heartland, to the extent that is no longer considered a safe seat.
And in fact for this particular election the Greens were the popular choice to
win.  In the end Labor won, but my interest is not so much tracing the votes,
but trying to map them.

Python has a vast suite of mapping tools, so much so that it may be that Python
has become the GIS tool of choice.  And there are lots of web pages devoted to
discussing these tools and their uses, such as [this
one](http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2017/09/21/accelerating-geopandas-1).

My interest was producing maps such as are produced by
[pollbludger](https://www.pollbludger.net/by-elections/fed-2018-03-batman.htm)
This is the image from that page:

![pollbludger](/pollbludger_batman.png)

As you can see there are basically three elements:

 * the underlying streetmap
 * the border of the division
 * the numbers showing the percentage wins of each party at the various polling
    booths.

I wanted to do something similar, but replace the numbers with circles whose
sizes showed the strength of the percentage win at each place.

*** Getting the information

Because this election was in a federal division, the management of the polls and
of the results (including counting the votes) was managed by the Australian
Electoral Commission, whose [pages about this by-election](
http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/supplementary_by_elections/2018-batman/) contain
pretty much all publicly available information.  You can copy and paste the
results from their pages, or download them as CSV files.

Then I needed to find the coordinates (Longitude and Latitude) of all the
polling places, of which there were 42 at fixed locations.  There didn't seem to
be a downloadable file for this, so for each booth address (given on the AEC
site), I entered it into Google Maps and copied down the coordinates as given.

The boundaries of all the divisions can again be downloaded from the [AEC GIS
page](http://www.aec.gov.au/Electorates/gis/index.htm).  These are given in
various standard GIS files.

*** Putting it all together

The tools I felt brave enough to use were:

  * [Pandas:](https://pandas.pydata.org) Python's data analysis library.  I
    really only needed to read information from CSV files that I could then use
    later.
  * [Geopandas:](http://geopandas.org) This is a GIS library with Pandas-like
    syntax, and is designed in part to be a GIS extension to Pandas.  I would
    use it to extract and manage the boundary data of the electoral division.
  * [Cartopy:](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/) which is a library of
    "cartographic tools".

And of course the standard [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) for plotting,
[numpy](http://www.numpy.org) for array handling.

My guides were the [London tube stations
example](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/gallery/tube_stations.html)
from Cartopy and a local (Australian) data analysis blog which discussed the
[use of Cartopy](http://www.net-analysis.com/blog/cartopytiles.html) including
adding graphics to an map image.

There are lots of other GIS tools for Python, some of which seem to be very good
indeed, and all of which I downloaded:

  * [Fiona](https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona): which is a "nimble" API for
    handling maps
  * [Descartes](https://bitbucket.org/sgillies/descartes/): which provides a
    means by which matplotlib can be used to manage geographic objects
  * [geoplotlib](https://github.com/andrea-cuttone/geoplotlib): for "visualizing
    geographical data and making maps"
  * [Folium](http://python-visualization.github.io/folium/): for visualizing maps
    using the [leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com) library.  It may be that the
    mapping I wanted to do with Python could have been done just as well in
    Javascript alone.  And probably other languages.  I stuck with Python simply
    because I knew it best.
  * [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/): which is designed to be a complete free
    and open source GIS, and with APIs both for Python and C++
  * [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org): the "Geospatial Data Abstraction Library" which
    has a [Python package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL) also called GDAL,
    for manipulating geospatial raster and vector data.

I suspect that if I was professionally working in the GIS area some or all of
these packages would be at least as - and maybe even more - suitable than the
ones I ended up using.  But then, I was starting from a position of absolute
zero with regards to GIS, and also I wanted to be able to make use of the tools
I already knew, such as Pandas, matplotlib, and numpy.

Here's the start, importing the libraries, or the bits of them I needed:

#+begin_src python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import cartopy.crs as ccrs
from cartopy.io.img_tiles import GoogleTiles
import geopandas as gpd
import pandas as pd
#+end_src

I then had to read in the election data, which was a CSV files from the AEC
containing the Booth, and the final distributed percentage weighting to the ALP
and Greens candidates, and heir percentage scores.  As well, I read in the
boundary data:

#+begin_src python
bb = pd.read_csv('Elections/batman_booths_coords.csv')  # contains all election info plus lat, long of booths
longs = np.array(bb['Long'])
lats = np.array(bb['Lat'])
v = gpd.read_file('VicMaps/VIC_ELB.MIF')  # all electoral divisions in MapInfo form
bg = v.loc[2].geometry                    # This is the Polygon representing Batman
b_longs = bg.exterior.xy[0]               # These next two lines are the longitudes and latitudes
b_lats = bg.exterior.xy[1]                #
#+end_src

Notice that =bb= uses Pandas to read in the CSV files which contains all the AEC
information, as well as the latitude and longitude of each Booth, which I'd
added myself.  Here =longs= and =lats= are the coordinates of the polling
booths, and =b_longs= and =b-lats= are all the vertices which form the boundary
of the division.

Now it's all pretty straigtforward, especially with the examples mentioned above:

#+begin_src python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(16,16))

tiler = GoogleTiles()
ax = plt.axes(projection=tiler.crs)

margin=0.01
ax.set_extent((bg.bounds[0]-margin, bg.bounds[2]+margin,bg.bounds[1]-margin, bg.bounds[3]+margin))

ax.add_image(tiler,12)
for i in range(44):
    plt.plot(longs[i],lats[i],ga2[i],markersize=abs(ga[i]),alpha=0.7,transform=ccrs.Geodetic())

plt.plot(b_longs,b_lats,'k-',linewidth=5,transform=ccrs.Geodetic())
plt.title('Booth results in the 2018 Batman by-election')
plt.show()
#+end_src 

Here =GoogleTiles= provide the street map to be used as the "base" of our map.
Open Streep Map (as OSM) is available too, but I thin in this instance, Google
Maps is better.  Because the map is rendered as an image (with some unavoidable
blurring), I find that Google gave a better result than OSM.

Also, =ga2= is a little array which simply produces plotting of the style =ro=
(red circle) or =go= (green circle).  Again, I make the program do most of the
work.

And here is the result, saved as an image:

![Batman 2018](/batman2018trim.png)

I'm quite pleased with this output.

And a quick check of some maths, first inline 
$ (x+2y)^3=x^3+6x^2y+12xy^2+8y^3 $ and also displayed:
<div>
$$
\int^\infty_{-\infty}e^{-x^2}\,dx=\sqrt{\pi}.
$$
</div>
