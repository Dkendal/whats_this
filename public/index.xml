      <description>This is the newest version of my &amp;ldquo;Numbers and Shapes&amp;rdquo; blog, containing material on elementary mathematics, mathematics education, software, and anything else that takes my fancy.
It is created in Hugo, a static blog engine which is blindingly fast, and works by simply serving up static html files (along with any necessary javascript). There is no database, and far less to fiddle with than with wordpress. Because it is static there is less opportunity for user input (such as comments) but that&amp;rsquo;s not an issue for me, as about 99.</description>

      <title>Presentations and the delight of js-reveal</title>

      <description>Presentations are a modern bugbear. Anybody in academia or business, or any professional field really, will have sat through untold hours of presentations. And almost all of them are terrible. Wordy, uninteresting, too many &amp;ldquo;transition effects&amp;rdquo;, low information content, you know as well as I do.
Pretty much every speaker reads the words on their slides, as though the audience were illiterate. I went to a talk once which consisted of 60 &amp;ndash; yes, sixty &amp;ndash; slides of very dense text, and the presenter read through each one.</description>

      <title>The Vigenere cipher in haskell</title>

      <description>Programming the Vigenère cipher is my go-to problem when learning a new language. It&amp;rsquo;s only ever a few lines of code, but it&amp;rsquo;s a pleasant way of getting to grips with some of the basics of syntax. For the past few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been wrestling with Haskell, and I&amp;rsquo;ve now got to the stage where a Vigenère program is in fact pretty easy.
As you know, the Vigenère cipher works using a plaintext and a keyword, which is repeated as often as need be:</description>

      <description>These are a class of root-finding methods; that is, for the numerical solution of a single nonlinear equation, developed by Alston Scott Householder in 1970. They may be considered a generalisation of the well known Newton-Raphson method (also known more simply as Newton&amp;rsquo;s method) defined by
\[ x\leftarrow x-\frac{f(x)}{f&amp;rsquo;(x)}. \]
where the equation to be solved is \(f(x)=0\).
From a starting value \(x_0\) a sequence of iterates can be generated by</description>

      <description>This was a comedy sketch initially performed in the revue &amp;ldquo;Clowns in Clover&amp;rdquo; which had its first performance at the Adelphi Theatre in London on December 1, 1927. This particular sketch was written by Dion Titheradge and starred the inimitable Cicely Courtneidge as the annoyed customer Mrs Spooner. It has been recorded and is available on many different collections; you can also hear it on youtube.
I have loved this sketch since I first heard it as a teenager on a three record collection called something like &amp;ldquo;Masters of Comedy&amp;rdquo;, being a collection of classic sketches.</description>

      <description>I recently came across some nice material on John Cook&amp;rsquo;s blog about equations that described eggs.
It turns out there are vast number of equations whose graphs are egg-shaped: that is, basically ellipse shape, but with one end &amp;ldquo;rounder&amp;rdquo; than the other.
You can see lots at Jürgen Köller&amp;rsquo;s Mathematische Basteleien page. (Although this blog is mostly in German, there are enough English language pages for monoglots such as me). And plenty of egg equations can be found in the 2dcurves pages.</description>

      <description>JSXGraph is a graphics package deveoped in Javascript, and which seems to be tailor-made for a static blog such as this. It consists of only two files: the javascript file itself, and an accompanying css file, which you can download. Alternaively you can simply link to the online files at the Javascript content delivery site cdnjs managed by cloudflare. There are cloudflare servers all over the world - even in my home town of Melbourne, Australia.</description>

      <title>The trinomial theorem</title>

      <description>When I was teaching the binomial theorem (or, to be more accurate, the binomial expansion) to my long-suffering students, one of them asked me if there was a trinomial theorem. Well, of course there is, although in fact expanding sums of greater than two terms is generally not classed as a theorem described by the number of terms. The general result is
\[ (x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_k)^n=\sum_{a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_k=n} {n\choose a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k}x_1^{a_1}x_2^{a_2}\cdots x_k^{a_k} \]
so in particular a &amp;ldquo;trinomial theorem&amp;rdquo; would be</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using wordpress as my blogging platform since I first started, about 10 years ago. (In fact the first post I can find is dated March 30, 2008.) I chose wordpress.com back then because it was (a) free, and (b) supported mathematics through a version (or subset) of LaTeX. As I have used LaTeX extensively for all my writing since the early 1990&amp;rsquo;s, it&amp;rsquo;s a standard requirement for me.</description>

      <title>Python GIS, and election results</title>

      <description>Election mapping A few weeks ago there was a by-election in my local electorate (known as an electoral division) of Batman here in Australia. I was interested in comparing the results of this election with the previous election two years ago. In this division it&amp;rsquo;s become a two-horse race: the Greens against the Australian Labor Party. Although Batman had been a solid Labor seat for almost its entire existence - it used to be considered one of the safest Labor seats in the country - over the past decade or so the Greens have been making inroads into this Labor heartland, to the extent that is no longer considered a safe seat.</description>
