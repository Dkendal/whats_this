      <description>Programming the Vigenère cipher is my go-to problem when learning a new language. It&amp;rsquo;s only ever a few lines of code, but it&amp;rsquo;s a pleasant way of getting to grips with some of the basics of syntax. For the past few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been wrestling with Haskell, and I&amp;rsquo;ve now got to the stage where a Vigenère program is in fact pretty easy.
As you know, the Vigenère cipher works using a plaintext and a keyword, which is repeated as often as need be:</description>
