This is the newest version of my "Numbers and Shapes" blog, containing material
on elementary mathematics, mathematics education, software, and anything else
that takes my fancy.

It is created in [Hugo](<https://gohugo.io/>), a static blog engine which is
blindingly fast, and works by simply serving up static html files (along with
any necessary javascript).  There is no database, and far less to fiddle with
than with wordpress.  Because it is static there is less opportunity for user
input (such as comments) but that's not an issue for me, as about 99.99% of
comments to my previous blog were spam.  User comments _can_ be configured,
using for example [Disqus](<https://disqus.com/>), but I won't bother.  If people
want to contact me, they can email.

And this is me, on the observation deck of the Oriental Pearl Tower, Shanghai:

All files relating to this blog are available on my github repo
[whats\_this](<https://github.com/amca01/whats_this>).  You can check the
configuration, the emacs org-file which contains what I actually write, and
files generated by [ox-hugo](<https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo>) and by Hugo
itself. The combinations of emacs, emacs org-mode, and ox-hugo, make creating
content for this blog a great pleasure, and far far easier than working with
wordpress.  The only issue I've found so far is that
[Mathjax](<https://www.mathjax.org/>) is not quite as powerful as the wordpress
[QuickLaTeX](<http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/quicklatex/>) plugin.  But that's
currently a price I'm very happy to pay.
